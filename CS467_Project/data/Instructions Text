Instructions Text

Welcome to Darkwood Castle, a text-based adventure game. 
To play this game, you start out in a room. You will decide to travel to various other rooms. 
There will be text that describes each room, some items that it contains and some directions in which you can travel.
There may be items that you can 'get', or you can examine something by saying 'look at'.
You can move from room to room by saying (n)orth, (s)uth, (e)ast, (w)est, (u)p or (d)own or (c)limb. 
There may be somewhere near 15 rooms, so you will probably need to create your own map of visited locations. 
There will be 10+ items to interact with, so you will probably need to create notes on these items.
You can check to see what you are carrying by typing '(i)nventory'.
You will be limited by the number of items that can be carried, and may be required to leave some before moving on.
Some places are dark, but you can find a candle to get through.
There are goals in the game, for example to retrieve a set number of gems.
There will be challenges to acquire certain items, and even a bonus treasure to find.
When you reach all goals and travel through the rooms, there is a final exit that will set you free.
