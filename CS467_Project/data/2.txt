Throne Room
As you push the door open, you discover you have entered the Throne Room. The king’s former throne is tarnished and covered by dust. A gleam is shining vaguely at the corner of the throne. You hear a slight sound and startle as the silence is broken. You realize you are not alone. A pair of golden eyes stares back at you from the shadow of the throne. It is the king’s wolfhound, ghostly but vigilant. He must be guarding something. There are three exits: North, East, and West.
The player is now inside the throne room. The throne is tarnished and dusty, but the ghost of the king’s wolfhound remains vigilant, guarding his king’s treasure.  There are three exits: North, East, and West.
