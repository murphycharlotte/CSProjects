Grand Foyer
You are in the Grand Foyer. A hint of sun shines through a window overhead, and the room becomes visible. Lavish artwork covers the walls. A wooden chest sits on a side table. "LOOK AROUND" the room to see what there is to discover. The "LOOK AT" the artwork and the chest to see if there is any treasure to "TAKE"! Everything sparkles, and it seems like there is a hint of magic here. At first, it looks like there is no easy way out. But then you see the doorways. Strangely, none of them lead you back outside the castle... There are four doorways out of the Foyer: North, East, South, and West.
