Royal Chambers
The Royal Chambers serve as a bedroom for the residing lord and lady. A heavy, hand-carved four-poster bed dominates the space. There are thick blankets on the beds, and tapestries on the walls. The air is damp and cold, as expected for a castle. There is a lavish fireplace, and blankets on the floor nearby where their favorite attendants must have slept. There is a multi-tiered chandelier hanging above the bed. There are three ways out of the Royal Chambers: North, East, and West.
