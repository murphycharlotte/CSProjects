The Solar
You are now in The Solar. This room in the castle has chairs scattered about. It is likely used by the king’s family while lounging in the afternoon. The room is so quiet, you can hear your own heartbeat. There is dust everywhere, especially on the writing desk. No one has visited in a very long time. You “look” for a way to “reveal”  other clues. There are  three ways out of The Solar: North, South, and East.
