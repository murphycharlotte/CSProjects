OBJECTIVES: You are trapped in an abandoned castle. The king and all the occupants mysteriously vanished after an evil wizard cursed the entire kingdom. It is said that, before he vanished, the king hid his treasure throughout the castle. A ferocious, treasure hoarding dragon guards the golden key that unlocks the Gatehouse. Your goal is to collect enough treasure to appease the dragon, lift the curse, and escape through the Gatehouse alive. 
FEATURES: Each room you visit has two features. You can use the command "LOOK AROUND" to see what features are available. And you can "LOOK AT [feature name]" to see specific features in more detail, reveal game hints, or reveal helpful items for your quest. A feature may require you to possess a specific item in your bag or solve a riddle before it will unlock its secrets.
ITEMS: If a feature reveals an item to you, it becomes available in the room for you to "PICK UP [item name]" or "TAKE [item name]". Use the command "LOOK AROUND" to see what items are available in the room, and use the command "LOOK AT [item name]" to view a specific item's description. You can "DROP [item]" to leave an item in any room. The item will remain available in the room until you return to pick it up again. The command "INVENTORY" will show you what items you have in your bag.
NAVIGATION: Each time you enter a room, you will see its name and description followed by a list of directions (North, East, South, West) that respesents doors to adjacent rooms. You can "GO [direction]" or "GO [room name]" to travel to an adjacent room. Use the command "LOOK AT MAP" to see a map of Darkwood Castle's rooms.
TIPS: The command "HELP" will show you a list of game commands. The command "INSTRUCTIONS" will display these instructions again. If in doubt, try "LOOK AROUND", "LOOK AT [feature or item]". Use the command "EXIT" to end the game, with the option to save.
