Armory
You are in the Armory. The room is giant. Everything in the room is made of silver, even the floor and the walls. All of the silver reflects like mirrors. You see infinite versions of yourself from the reflection like there are no boundaries in this room. You look around for the most powerful weapon to aid you on your journey.
