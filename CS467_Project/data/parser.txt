Words like Save, Load, Inventory, Steal and Help can be typed in as a single word. Other works such as Go, Drink etc, will require an object (objectOne)[example: Go North] or two objects with a preposition (objectOne "with" objectTwo)[example: remove sword from inventory] to be mentioned. 

These words are filtered out:
If a user types them, they will be ignored.
The (with a space prior), The (with a space after), (.), ('s) and (!). 
  
   Prepositions:
   
   bool hasPreposition;
   
  std::string preposition;
  std::string firstObject;
  std::string secondObject;
  
  
ParsedInput  Separate(std::string input);
ParsedInput ValidateInput(ParsedInput p);
std::string Capitalize (std::string str);
bool FindPreposition (std::string input);


	boost::trim(input); 
  // Trim algorithms are used to remove trailing and leading spaces from a sequence (string).
